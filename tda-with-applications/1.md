# 1 - Introduction

### what is cluster analysis?



### How do we study shapes of data points in TDA ?
- metric space - the distance measures the dissimilarities between the data points
- with this metric - data points are embedded into a complex shape 


### What mathematical tools used in TDA ?
- metric space works **organizing** large amounts of data
- topology used to study shapes in two ways :
  1. combinatorial representations (via a discretization process, where we loose information about the detail picture of the shape)
  2. homological signatures  (count the occurences of patterns within the shape)


### What are the goals of the book ?
- matrix algorithm to compute topological invariants (Betti numbers) in the domain of *point clouds* or *finite metric spaces*
- standard methods of *homology* + **adpatation of homology** to *point clouds* - called **persistent homology**
- study the (continuous & discrete properties unlike Betti numbers) invariants from *persistent homology* namely *persitence diagram* or *perstistence barcodes*
- describe *applications* of topological methods to various fields.

### Introductory examples (*mindset* : quantitative approach -> qualitative tools): 
- diabete : 2 geometric features (a ball and two "ears") - computing the number of connected component of the patient help identify if he is of *type I* or *type II*
- periodic motion : knowing the positions of an object one might ask if the motion forms a closed loop or even (without any coordinate system) if you have a family of images (video) where each point lies in a high dimensional space and you want to find if the motion forms a closed loop.
- curves and shape recognition : to differentiate between two hand writtend digits : loops ("A" and "B"), curves ("C" and "I"), corners ("U" and "V"), edges and vertices (cube VS tetrahedron)
