# 1 - Introduction

### what is cluster analysis?



### How do we study shapes of data points in TDA ?
- metric space - the distance measures the dissimilarities between the data points
- with this metric - data points are embedded into a complex shape 


### What mathematical tools used in TDA ?
- metric space works **organizing** large amounts of data
- topology used to study shapes in two ways :
  1. combinatorial representations (via a discretization process, where we loose information about the detail picture of the shape)
  2. homological signatures  (count the occurences of patterns within the shape)


### What are the goals of the book ?
- matrix algorithm to compute topological invariants in the domain of *point clouds* or *finite metric spaces*
- standard methods of homology + adpatation of homology to *point clouds* - called *persistent homology*
